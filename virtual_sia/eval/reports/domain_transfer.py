    Measures whether concepts formed from original families activate on new families.

    Legitimate Theft source: Transfer learning metrics from domain adaptation
    literature (Ben-David et al. 2010). The concept of measuring activation
    overlap across domains is adapted from cross-domain representation analysis
    in neural transfer learning. What we took: the measurement framework.
    What we left: the neural-network-specific implementation. What we have now:
    a symbolic concept-transfer metric suitable for cognitive agent evaluation.
