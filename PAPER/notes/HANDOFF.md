## ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST — Master entry points

If you're returning to this project after time away, **start here**:

1. **`PROJECT_README.md`** (repo root) — master entry point with file map, rules, roles
2. **`AGENT_OPERATING_MANUAL.md`** (repo root) — ⭐ NEW S13.7 — how to work on this project without damaging it
3. **`MASTER_TIMELINE.md`** (repo root) — canonical chronological story of all sessions
4. **`CONTRIBUTION_LEDGER.md`** (repo root) — single source of truth for attribution per artifact
5. **`AUDIT_REPORT_S13.6.md`** (repo root) — last consistency audit findings
6. **`CLEANUP_INVENTORY_S13.7.md`** (repo root) — ⭐ NEW S13.7 — inventory of old/redundant files awaiting Fares decision
7. **`PAPER_PROTOCOL.md`** — v2.0 Theoretical Mode rules + §12.2 Creative Attribution Rule
8. **This file** (HANDOFF) — operational current state + open paths

These 8 docs replace the need to read 13+ session logs to get oriented. **`AGENT_OPERATING_MANUAL.md` (added S13.7) is the must-read for any new agent.**

---

## ⚠️ The Mode + Two Governance Rules

**Mode:** Sessions 6–13 all under **Theoretical Mode** (no new runs, no API calls, no benchmark execution). 7 delegations from Fares ("القرار قرارك" / "القرار عندك" / "نعم اشتغل" / "تمام") have been the operational pattern.

**Rule 1 — Mode Pivot (S6):** No operational work without explicit Fares request.
**Rule 2 — Creative Attribution (Idea-002, S7):** Every Fares contribution → `Idea-NNN` file + ATTRIBUTION_MAP entry. Every agent-initiated work → labelled separately. Re-reading exercise (option F) catches misattributions; Session 12 found 3 (Theory-08, Theory-10, Phil-07); Session 12b corrected.

---

## 🆕 What just happened — Session 14 (§15 Theoretical Frame → v0.8)

**Trigger:** Fares: *"تمام اللي انت شايفه"* (delegation — agent chooses path).

**Agent's choice:** Path 1c from S13 HANDOFF — NEW §15 "Theoretical Frame: Tiered Externalized Recursive Intelligence". This was the agent's top pick since Session 13.

**What was added to PAPER.md (~110 lines):**

| Sub-section | Content |
|---|---|
| §15.1 Framework Name + Operational Definition | TERI acronym unpacked; intelligence = "organized adaptive epistemic control under bounded resources" |
| §15.2 The Eight Grand Pillars | 8 pillars: 4 covered, **4 absent** (Contradiction Mgmt, Local Theory Building, Self-Benchmarking, Agent Identity) |
| §15.3 Seven-Layer Architecture | Experience→Memory→Abstraction→Theory→Governance→Economic→Reflexive Identity |
| §15.4 Maturity Ladder | Stages 0-6; GENESIS at 1-2, LEAP at 3-4; 110-point gap = 2-stage maturity gap |
| §15.5 Epistemic Artifact Inventory (Table 18) | 11 artifacts × 5 value dimensions (M/D/R/E/T) |
| §15.6 What This Frame Reveals | 3 insights: absent pillars = deepest limitation; frame makes theories coherent; maturity gap = fundamental explanation |

**Attribution:** Layer 1 (Fares-originated — all from `GENESIS_Meta_Theory_AR.md`, pre-2026, discovered S13); Layer 2 (agent-placed).

**Paper version:** v0.7 → **v0.8**. **Commit:** `b86af6b`.

**Keywords updated:** Added "Tiered Externalized Recursive Intelligence", "epistemic artifacts".

**⚠️ Bug discovered:** Keywords accidentally injected into §8.5.4 Theory-09 sentence body (line ~782). Fix needed.

## ✅ Cumulative state (as of Session 14)

### Theoretical stack
- **6 lenses:** Theory-07/08/09/10 + Phil-07 + §15 TERI Frame (all in `PAPER/theory/`, `PAPER/philosophy/`, and PAPER.md §15)
- **Attribution corrected (S12b):** Theory-08, Theory-10, Phil-07 now correctly classified as "agent-formalized, Fares-originated"
- **§15 TERI Frame (S14):** Names the 8-pillar framework, maturity ladder, 7-layer architecture, Table 18
- **Theory-10 P6** (lifetime drift) added S12b — novel, not in T5.93/T5.94
- **Phil-07 §9** (Position D as stable attractor) added S12b

### Master Index thefts (5.1-5.94)
- T5.91 (ours), T5.92 (LEAP), T5.93 (Wu), T5.94 (Chen UVA+Google)

### Research artifacts (PAPER/notes/)
- `INTERNAL_RE_READING_SESSION_12.md` — 12 discoveries (5 docs)
- `INTERNAL_RE_READING_SESSION_13.md` — 11 discoveries (4 docs)
- **Cumulative S12+S13+S14: 37 discoveries from 14 of 122 foundational docs**

## 🎯 Next: paths in order of agent recommendation

The 5 paths from Session 13 remain open. **Session 13.7 adds a NEW Path A0: cleanup decisions.**

### Path A0 — NEW (S13.7) — Cleanup decisions on Layer A docs

`CLEANUP_INVENTORY_S13.7.md` inventories ~95 Layer A files awaiting Fares decision. Choose:
- **Policy A:** "نفّذ كل الـ recommendations" (execute all 🟡 ARCHIVE + 🔴 DELETE actions)
- **Policy B:** "نفّذ ARCHIVE فقط، ما تحذفش حاجة" (archive only, never delete)
- **Policy C:** "ابدأ بالـ critical فقط" (just `test_pioneer.py` delete + `virtual_genesis/eval/results/` archive — saves 96 MB immediately)
- **Policy D:** "خلي كل حاجة زي ما هي" (keep all; inventory was reference only)
- **Per-section:** Specify action per section (1-21)

**Estimated work:**
- Policy A: ~30 min of file moves + archive READMEs
- Policy B: similar (just no deletes)
- Policy C: ~10 min (smallest scope, biggest disk savings)
- Policy D: 0 min

**Agent recommendation:** **Policy B** (archive everything, delete nothing). Git history preserves anyway; archive folder makes the working tree navigable; no permanent loss.

### Original 5 paths (from Session 13):

### ~~Path 1c~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 14) — NEW §15 "Theoretical Frame"
**Added:** ~110 lines to PAPER.md as §15. TERI framework named, 8 pillars mapped, 7-layer architecture, maturity ladder, Table 18 (11 epistemic artifacts × 5 values). v0.7 → v0.8. Commit `b86af6b`.

### ~~Path 1b~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 14) — §14 Ethics updated
**Added:** Agent Identity Theory citation in §14 intro + §14.1; §14.4 renamed "partially resolved open question" with Delegated Cognition / External Advice distinction. v0.8 → v0.8.1. Commit `6dde4a8`.

### ~~Path 2~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 14) — Re-reading batch 4
**Read:** 5 docs (~2,820 lines): Local Theory Building, Cognitive Economy Ledger & Tier Router, Core Ontology, Memory OS, Concept Selectivity. **14 major discoveries** (GEMs 24-33 + Discoveries 34-37). Cumulative: 37 discoveries from 14 of 122 docs. Commit `f1e79b3`.

### ~~Path A (from batch 4)~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 14) — §15 sharpened
**Added:** Dependency chain note (§15.2), Four Tests quality criterion (§15.4), zero-concept honest caveat (§8.5.8). v0.8.1 → v0.8.2. Commit `a06f077`.

### Path 2 — Re-read batch 5 (5+ more foundational docs) ⭐ TOP PICK

Next priority queue: Contradiction Ledger Spec, Anomaly/Crisis Manager Spec, Identity Object Spec, Evaluation Redesign, Module API Contracts, and 108 other foundational docs. Per S12-S14 yield rate (~2.65 discoveries/doc), batch 5 expected to surface 10-14 more discoveries.

### Path 3 — Draft a new Theory-NN candidate

8 candidates now surfaced across S12 + S13 + S14:
- Theory-11A: Reasoning Tier Asymmetry (Tiered Intelligence + Theory-10)
- Theory-12A: Premium Compute Rule (Cognitive Economy §22)
- Theory-11B: Task-Ontology Selection (Paradigm Layer 1 gap)
- Theory-12B: Improvement Regime Taxonomy (Paradigm Layer 5 gap)
- Theory-13: Negative Memory primitive (Memory OS §4.7 + Productive Forgetting §13.4 — now confirmed as *spec'd component*, not just theory)
- 3-tier Value Framework (Cognitive Economy 7D → Theory-08 2D → Self-Benchmarking §10 4D)
- Epistemic Artifact accounting (Meta-Theory §9)
- System Integrity Invariants (Core Ontology §5 — 9 global invariants)

### Path 4 — Idea-003 from Fares

INBOX empty. Any source (paper link, idea, observation, question) gets full Idea-001-style treatment.

### Path 5 — Submission preparation

Anonymization for double-blind venues + BibTeX bibliography + final figure formatting (some still ASCII). Cosmetic but increasingly viable now that paper has §§12-15 + §8.5.7 + §8.6.

## ✍️ Workflow for the next session

1. Read `PROJECT_README.md` (5 min)
2. Read this file (3 min)
3. Read `CONTRIBUTION_LEDGER.md` if doing anything touching attribution (10 min)
4. Read `MASTER_TIMELINE.md` if you want full context (15 min)
5. Read `PAPER.md` v0.8.2 if doing paper edits (20 min)
6. Ask Fares: **"Path 1b (small §14 edits citing Agent Identity Theory), Path 2 (re-read batch 4), Path 3 (Theory-NN candidate), Path 4 (Idea-003), Path 5 (submission prep), or Path 6 (fix §8.5.4 keyword injection bug)?"**

**Rules (non-negotiable):**
- ❌ No runs / API calls / benchmarks
- ❌ No unilateral PAPER.md edits — always propose, await authorization, then execute
- ❌ Do not `git add -A` — explicit paths only
- ❌ Do not include `genesis/tasks/longcot-chess/*.py` or `push_runs.sh` in commits (file-permission diffs, not agent work)
- ✅ Update CONTRIBUTION_LEDGER + MASTER_TIMELINE + ATTRIBUTION_MAP whenever new artifact appears
- ✅ Preserve verbatim Arabic utterances exactly
- ✅ Before push: `git diff HEAD | grep -E "sk-or-v1-|sk-proj-|gsk_|csk-|AIzaSy|github_pat_|nvapi-|ghp_"` must be empty

## 🔥 The single most important demonstration so far

The Creative Attribution Rule (Idea-002, Session 7) is now demonstrably functional as a true attribution safety net, not a rhetorical gesture:

- **Session 12** found that 3 of 5 theoretical artifacts had been mis-attributed
- **Session 12b** applied corrections under explicit Fares authorization
- **Session 13** found 1 more correction pending + 4-pillar coverage gap
- **Session 13.5** consolidated all of this into 3 new master docs so it can't be lost
- **Session 14** placed the entire TERI framework into §15 — every piece authored by Fares (Meta-Theory pre-2026), discovered by agent re-reading (S13), placed under delegation (S14)

This is what makes the project ethically defensible under NeurIPS 2025 LLM policy. Everything else (the 5-lens stack, the 110-point LEAP contrast, the empirical anchors) is the *content*. The attribution governance is the *process*. The paper documents both honestly.

---

## Session 14 single most important consequence

With §15, the paper now explicitly names the theoretical framework it operates within. Theories 07-10 + Phil-07 are no longer ad hoc explanations for a −10 gap — they are revealed as *partial coverage of a coherent 8-pillar framework*. The gaps in coverage (4 absent pillars) are as informative as the coverage itself. This elevates the paper from "honest negative result + theories" to "honest negative result + theories + the frame that explains why these theories and not others."

If you (Fares / future agent / future maintainer / reviewer) ever feel lost in this project, **you now have a single entry point** (`PROJECT_README.md`) that will tell you where to go next. You no longer need to read 13 session logs to understand the state. That was the goal of Session 13.5.

The 3 master docs are mutually consistent (`CONTRIBUTION_LEDGER §9` records the last consistency check). If any of them diverges from the others in future, the resolution rule is:
1. `CONTRIBUTION_LEDGER` wins on attribution questions
2. `MASTER_TIMELINE` wins on chronological questions
3. `PROJECT_README` wins on "where is X" questions
4. `PAPER.md` wins on the official scientific record

And update the others to match.
